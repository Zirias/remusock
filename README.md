## remusock

This package contains a single and simple daemon, `remusockd`, allowing to
access a Unix domain socket on a remote machine.

```
Usage: remusockd [-cfnv] [-b address]
                [-g group] [-m mode] [-p pidfile]
                [-r remotehost] [-u user] socket port

        -b address     when listening, only bind to this address
                       instead of any
        -c             open unix domain socket as client
        -f             run in foreground
        -g group       group name or id for the server socket,
                       if a user name is given, defaults to the
                       default group of that user
        -m mode        permissions for the server socket in octal,
                       defaults to 600
        -n             numeric hosts, do not resolve remote addresses
        -p pidfile     use `pidfile' instead of compile-time default
        -r remotehost  connect to `remotehost' instead of listening
        -u user        user name or id for the server socket
                       when started as root, run as this user
        -v             verbose logging output

        socket         unix domain socket to open
        port           TCP port to connect to or listen on
```

### Limitations

* *No encryption, no authentication!* â€” use this tool only in trusted networks
* event loop is based on `pselect()`, so this doesn't scale to huge numbers
  of connections

### Features

* Multiple socket connections tunnelled through a single TCP connection
* TCP can work in either direction between socket server and socket client
* TCP connections are monitored, the client side attempts to automatically
  restore a lost connection

### Building

1. Clone the source from git:

        git clone https://github.com/Zirias/remusock
        cd remusock

2. (optional) check out a specific release:

        git checkout v1.1

3. get [`zimk`](https://github.com/Zirias/zimk) (the GNU make based build
   system)

        git submodule update --init

4. build it

        make -j4 strip

   this assumes `make` is GNU make. You'll have to type `gmake` instead on
   a BSD system, for example.

### FreeBSD port

There's a FreeBSD port in my local ports tree (caution, it's rebased all the
time) here: https://github.com/Zirias/zfbsd-ports/tree/local/net/remusock

It contains an init-script that allows easy configuration in `/etc/rc.conf`.
Here's what I use to make dovecot's auth socket available on a remote machine:

```
remusock_enable="YES"
remusock_socket="/var/run/dovecot/auth-client"
remusock_user="dovecot"
remusock_remotehost="192.168.91.1"
remusock_sockclient="YES"
```

### Linux/systemd

Remusock doesn't integrate with `systemd` (and never will), but it's of course
possible to create a "systemd unit" for it. I'll just cite myself here:

```
As I need the tool on a Debian box as well, I hacked together a systemd unit.
I now feel like _not_ publishing it. systemd wants me to use a "simple" mode
with the daemon running in foreground (which remusockd can do, of course),
only problem is, there's no way to check for successful startup. systemd wants
me to solve this by using a "notifying" mode where my daemon is supposed to
call some systemd API (wtf? alternative: dbus. again: wtf?). I used the
(strongly discouraged) "forking" mode instead, which works just fine with a
well-behaved daemon. Then, for configuring the service, systemd wants me to
use "snippets" in unit-syntax or something like that. Doesn't work for me, I
just hardcoded the command line options I need for my usecase.

It's just crap. Whoever wants to use remusock with systemd, please write your
own unit file (and I recommend to use the "discouraged" forking mode).
```
